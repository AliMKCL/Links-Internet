# Notes
1) Currently runs locally only, diployment via docker/ec2 is planned.
2) For the initial state of the database after docker container is ready, use these queries to access existing data:
   - Best weapons in ...
   - Best armor in ...
   - Best recipes in ...
   - How to beat (boss name) in ...
   - How to beat ... in ...
   - How to kill farm lynels in ...
   - How best ways to get rupees in ...
   - How to activate tower in ...
   - How to get dragon items in ...
   - How to dupe in ...
3) Keep in mind all data comes from reddit, meaning if an answer to a query does not appear relevant, chances are enough of such posts do not exist in reddit.
